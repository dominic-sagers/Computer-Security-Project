# Welcome

Thank you for trying out (and totally not trying to destroy) our modest client-server application!

How to use:

1. Run the flaskServer.py python file to start the server and check the terminal for a URL to connect to the server.
- In the terminal you should follow the IP address that is longer, and if you use another device it should follow this address as well.

2. Enter your username and password.
- If nothing happens, your password is probably invalid, and you should see what part of your password was incorrect by checking the terminal log.

3. After creating a profile, you will now begin the exciting part... Using the highly interactive text boxes you may increment and decrement your very own special number (no other program has ever given the user such freedom).

4. When you are done with your very special number, you may destroy it and everything else that makes you who you are (your profile information) by clicking the "Logout and delete profile"
